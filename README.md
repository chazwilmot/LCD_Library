# LCD_Library
Adaptation of Joerg Wunsch HD44780 Library https://github.com/vancegroup-mirrors/avr-libc/tree/master/avr-libc/doc/examples/stdiodemo


I used Joerg Wunsch's library for the HD44780 LCD and make changes and added functions to allow for easier use and the ability to use a 2x16 LCD rather than a 1x16 that the library was designed for.
